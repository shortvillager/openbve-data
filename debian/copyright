    I have been approached by some individuals over the time, including
    from the GNU project and the Ubuntu Foundation (as it appears at
    least), and was told that they lack a means of "legal security" for
    reuse without an explicit license. You can read my above post on
    details about my attitude regarding this matter, but as a start, I
    have decided to put the following line on the homepage and will also
    include it in any later release:

      " This program, along with all documentation provided, is dedicated
	to the public. I do not pose any restrictions on how this material
	can be used, and explicitly encourage redistribution and
	modification for any purpose. "

  Any Debian-packaging additions are hereby placed into the Public Domain.
